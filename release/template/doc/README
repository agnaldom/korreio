3. Dependencies Instalation
***************************

   3.1 Debian-like

      # echo 'Aptitude::Recommends-Important "false";' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf
      # aptitude install python-qt3 python-ldap python-pexpect python-smbpasswd

   3.2 Redhat-like
   ***************
      # yum install PyQt python-ldap pexpect python-smbpasswd

   3.3 Windows
   ***********
      > python-2.4.4.msi
      > python-qt3-3.3.4.win32-py2.4.exe
      > python-ldap-2.0.6.win32-py2.4.exe

4. Running, using and related configuration
*******************************************

   # Open Korreio and configure services.
   /path/korreio.py

   4.1 Queue Manager sudo configuration
   ************************************

       The example above for /etc/sudoers, the user 'operator' can exec only
   postfix related commands without password request.

       operator   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/postqueue, /usr/sbin/postcat, /usr/sbin/postsuper

       And set 'operator' user on Korreio SSH conection.

5. Language
***********

   Language is detected by $LANG environment variable.
   Change $LANG to force some language.
      # LANG=en_US ./korreio.py
      # LANG=pt_BR ./korreio.py

6. Know Tips
************

   6.1 Connection timeout to SSH
   *****************************

       SSH do reverse DNS lookup and cause delay if IP don't have a
    PTR RR. You always need reverse DNS properly configured.
       However you can increase the timeout for ssh connection
    establishment:

    # sed -i 's/login_timeout=20/login_timeout=180/' korreiolib.py

   6.2 Queue manager actions don't work
   ************************************

       Some SSH queries require 'here strings' functionality, that is
   available on BASH3. Then is required the change default shell to BASH.

       'here strings' (<<<) example:
         $ cut -f1,2 -d. <<< '3.1.17(1)-release'
         > 3.1

   6.3 Queue manager don't show recipients for local users
   *******************************************************

       Yes, currently Queue Manager don't show message recipients for
    users without @, commonly from sendmail.postfix (postdrop) command,
    because current regexp don't match. Maybe I fix one day.
       Usually there is no reason for these messages to stay in queue,
    if this often occurs fix the reason.

   6.4 After set expire values cyrus starter is slower
   ***************************************************

       By default cyrus is configured in cyrus.conf to run delprune to
   remove expired messages at startup (START). Then messages will be
   processed before listen for connections. You should disable delprune
   at startup and add it to EVENTS:

       delprune  cmd="/usr/sbin/cyr_expire -E 3" at=0100

       So messages will be expired at 1pm. all days.

   6.5 Can't connect to sieve
   **************************

       By default sieve daemon listen at port 2000 only for localhost.
    You can change cyrus.conf to:

       sieve     cmd="timsieved" listen="sieve" prefork=0 maxchild=100

       You can permit access to port 2000 only for administratives IP
    on firewall.

7. Know Bugs
************

   7.1 Korreio crash if a referral references diferrent base DN prefix
   *******************************************************************

       Korreio support referral only in same base DN. This is a design
    restriction because Korreio can build tree for only one Base DN.

       Workaround: well, Korreio don't have support to this referral.

       Note: maybe solved on v20090302.

   7.2 Korreio freeze if a referral references non-existent DN
   ***********************************************************

       This is a python-ldap library problem, is not Korreio specific.
    Python-ldap freeze and alloc all computer memory until to be killed
    by kernel if referral references non-existent DN and expand referral
    is activate.

       Workaround: disable referral expand in ldap connection configuration
    and setting the referral to reference a existent DN.

   7.3 Error on copy/paste and rename (edit) DN
   ********************************************

       Korreio after version 20090327 use only method MODRDN to cut/paste
    and rename (edit) DN, and MODRDN is supported only by HDB.
       If you don't want migrate now to HDB, you need use Korreio version
    20090302 to copy and paste entries.

        A simple example to migration BDB to HDB above (backup your data!):
            # /etc/init.d/slapd stop
            # slapcat -l backup.ldif
            # sed -i 's/bdb/hdb/g' /etc/ldap/slapd.conf
            # rm /var/lib/ldap/*
            # slapadd -l backup.ldif
            # slapindex
            # chown -R openldap: /var/lib/ldap
            # /etc/init.d/slapd start
